Consecutive Sum
Write two or more Algorithms to compute consecutive sums. Determine their time  and space complexities.

Given an integer array A[0 .. n-1] and a positive integer k <= n, return an array ConsecutiveSum with following property:
ConsecutiveSum[0] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[k-1],
ConsecutiveSum[1] = A[1] + A[2] + ... + A[k],
and so on.

81 Coins Problem
Prof. Prem gave you 81 coins. All of them look alike. However, exactly one has lesser weight.

Write an algorithm to identify the coin with lesser weight. You are given a "Mechanical Scale".
Your algorithm can use the scale at most FOUR times.

What is the time complexity (Assume one use of the scale is O(1)).
