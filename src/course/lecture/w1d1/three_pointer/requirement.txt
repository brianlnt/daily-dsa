Pattern 1. Three pointers
Read Lesson 1.

Google and write down:
an iterative algorithm to compute gcd.
an iterative algorithm to compute the n-th Fibonacci number.
an an iterative algorithm to reverse a singly linked list.
Study and practice all three algorithms.

Q1. What is common to all three algorithms?
Q2. What are their time complexities?
